#
# 1, Load a fits file and creat an array of image data after uniti conversion.
# 2, Plot (Pop-up) the image map. You can specify the ranges of axes.
# 3, Calculate the radius for the initial center position,
#    and create the circle on the maser map.
# 4, Search the center position using the original logarithmic flux data (without random noise)
# 5, Search for the optimum center position using Monte Carlo method.
# 6, Plot the histogram of center position obtained in tmask 5.
# 7, Plot the Final Map
# 8, Calcurate ring width
